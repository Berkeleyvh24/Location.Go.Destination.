"The only way forward is by knowing that you don't need to actually go anywhere in the first place."

Let's get one thing straight, relationships between concepts are probably the most intriguing and 
fascinating part of this world for me as an individual. I don't know about you lot, but delving into
the underlying mechanisms in which two seemingly separate entities such as music and chemistry can 
be bounded together, like elements from the periodic table "playing together" to create new compounds
and reactions. The bread and butter of emergent behaviour is the aspect that the the behaviour itself
doesn't tie into the fact that the chaotic nature seen by the viewer isn't actually chaos but a 
higher order we can't perceive straight off the bat. 

This is well described by swallows in their own flock abiding conduct, the way they at first appear 
to watcher is a chaotic sense of movement where they move unpredictably, though they actually conform
to a higher sense of order that is governed by simple, local rules such as alignment, attraction and
repulsion between themselves. These rules lead localised interactions to relay into global patterns
where one swallow or entity's behaviour coalesces to one collective movement based upon the interactiveness
of the singular entities. 

Nature of this sort doesn't just stop at the animals, it delves deeper into chemical reactions and even
the elements themselves such as the resultant behviour to the movements of the neighbour entities based 
upon external stimuli. Underlying foundational laws pressured by chaotic changes seem to always bounce
into an emergence of a stable result, such as where heat or pressure breaking individual bonds in elements
leads to forming new, even more stable structures. Where I'm going with this is that localised chaos can
exhibit resilience, but what is this resilience if not order? Chaos is diversity at the individual level
contributes to the richness and functionality of the whole, where order can be seen.

How do both systems—swallows and chemical reactions—balance individual freedom (randomness/chaos) with 
collective stability (order)?

How do the concepts of chaos and order in emergent systems challenge our understanding of predictability 
and control in natural systems?

Peace.
